                I'm a full time student at the University of Melbourne, and I have been for a long time now. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in 2017, majoring in Pure Mathematics. I continued pursuing this for another year, and half-completed my Master's in the field. Unfortunately, the degree wasn't flexible enough for me to pursue my passion for computer science and statistics, so I decided to leave the degree and start my journey anew with a Graduate Diploma in Data Science.
